# Thoughts on Building UX

## Introduction

I like to call myself a full stack web developer. Being a freelancer for years, I had the opportunity (read: forced) to work on different technologies on both frontend and backend. Truth be told, I am not an expert in any of those things. Sure, I may have a particular skillset (in Liam Neeson's _Taken_ voice) but my skill level in any area is nothing compared to, say, a dedicated frontend or backend developer.

Just recently, I got the chance to focus on frontend development. Just days into it, I remembered an old realization that just proves to be true, time and time again:

> Building good UX is d*mn hard. Anyone who tells you otherwise is full of sh*t.

Having said that, I like to think of myself as someone who, given enough time, can thrive on any particular task. And UI/UX (you may point out that these two are completely different things, and you are right), however inexperienced I may be in this area, should be no exception.

I'm going to list down my thoughts and some of the things I learned (or re-learned) about building UX. Before going any further, as a warning I'd like to point out that I may just be pulling all these words out of my a** (read: I may just be making all this sh*t up). However, you've already read this far so might as well just finish the whole d*mn thing.

## Thoughts

### Everything Starts with the End User

Good UX is more than just a combination of nice-looking UI elements. Instead, it encompasses the entire collection of user interactions. Therefore, good UX must have a set of  clearly-defined, intuitive user flows built into its DNA.

It goes without saying that a good UI design should not keep the user guessing. As the saying goes:

![user interface](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAZKAAAAJDIwODMxYjdhLTgyMTktNDk3Zi05NzAxLTQ0ZmJiOGUzZTQwNg.jpg "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ux-tips-patrick-leinen")

However, designing an _intuitive_ UI  can sometimes be difficult. This is because like many other things, _intuitiveness_ is relative.
What _you_ find very intuitive might not be as easy to understand for _me_.

It's all a matter of perspective. And it differs for a lot of people, for a number of reasons: age, technical background, clarity of vision, among other things.

> We do not see things as they are. We see things as we are. - Some random guy on Reddit

I think the _key_ is to not only define your target users, but also attempt to strike a balance between **simplicity** and **usability**. By attempting to view the whole set of flows from a target user's perspective, one can potentially have good insights on a much more effective UX design.

### Small Details Matter

![small details](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lowres.cartoonstock.com/business-commerce-hr-personnel_department-detail-trouser-absent_minded-dwh110621_low.jpg "https://www.cartoonstock.com/directory/p/personal_departments.asp")

It may just be me (and my severe case of stupid OCD), but I get more attracted to something that obviously puts a lot of attention to details. In all my years of experience, I find it amusing that even small details can have a large impact to the overall end user experience. These include:

- typos
- misaligned buttons
- bad spacing
- poorly constructed alert messages

Granted, to us developers these quirks may seem very minor (cause we have _way bigger problems_ to solve, right?). They can be fixed within minutes (even seconds in some cases). But make no mistake, once they add up they can hurt as bad as a major bug. This might be an exaggeration to some extent, but even minor UI issues in production could make a company lose a lot of money.

Therefore, it is extremely important to include QA testing in any workflow. Because a design that consistently pays attention to small details not only looks clean and elegant, but also promotes trust from its end users. It actually says a d*mn _LOT_ about how a company values its customers.

### Constructive Criticism is Gold

![criticism](https://viralviralvideos.com/wp-content/uploads/meme/2014/03/-Comics---Criticism-Funny-MEME-GIF.jpg "https://www.viralviralvideos.com/2014/03/06/comics-criticism/")

If there's one thing I learned the hard way, it's that we should be always open for criticism - no matter how harsh they may seem to be. Here's why: **We make mistakes whether we like it or not.**

Sometimes, we put too much hardwork on something only to get our egos crushed by honest criticism. Let me tell you something: F*ck egos. They provide a false sense of entitlement which could potentially create a gap between ourselves and people around us.

It is never about you. It's about building something the best you could, and that includes getting feedback from as many people as possible.

Again, this is about _perspective_. What makes constructive criticism important is that not only it makes us aware of _where_ we f*cked up, but also provides helpful advice on how not to. It gives a whole level of perspective which we won't be able to attain by ourselves.

By opening ourselves to constructive criticism, we effectively put ourselves in the best position for growth.

### Always Iterate. Never settle.

> When you're finished changing, you're finished. -Benjamin Franklin

Technology changes at a very rapid pace, and people demand much better user experiences more than ever. What's hip and cool right now could become obsolete eighteen months later.

As a result, product design must adapt to the ever changing user requirements. A good design is always a work in progress. The moment you stop iterating is the moment your product starts dying.

That doesn't mean that you should just mindlessly slap every new d*mn trend into your design as it comes along. This is where A/B testing proves to be useful. If something works, keep it. Otherwise revert to the old version and move on.

The secret is to never be afraid to try something new. Don't be afraid to fail or alienate your users. There is always something that can be learned through failure. That alone is a good reason why there's no such thing.

### One more thing...

Something said by a brilliant colleague struck me:

> You can't build a revolutionary product with a traditional UI.

Those might not be the exact words because I always screw up when it comes to remembering things, but hopefully that's the gist of it.

I think it means that UI should be the best possible reflection of not just what a product can do, but also how _it empowers_ its users. As flawless an end user product's backend may be, it still needs at least an equally good user interface to appeal to customers.

The question is: What constitutes a revolutionary UI?

There could be a lot of things. But to be honest, I have no idea. I'll just recognize one when I see it. That hardest part is to come up with something that can be classified as "revolutionary design".

If we think about it, "revolutionary" could mean one of these things:

- profound
- extraordinary
- rebellious

If we look deeper into it, we could say that a revolutionary UI is something that allows the user to do what he/she wants to do in a way that is orders of magnitude better than what is accustomed to. So perhaps asking these questions might help us get some clues:

- What does the user want to achieve when using our product?
- What are the ways to achieve it?
- How many steps are involved?
- Are there ways to reach that goal without going through these steps?

Of course, this won't guarantee anything. Sometimes it takes a lot of imagination and hardwork. Sometimes there is no good starting point. Just start anyway. You'll never know the true extent of what you can come up with.

### Summary

Building a good user experience is hard. But if you pay attention to details, embrace criticism and iterate constantly, it will make the process a whole lot easier.

Cheers!

TL;DR I got the chance to focus on building UI/UX and learned awesome sh*t in the process.
