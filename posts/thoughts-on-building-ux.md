# Thoughts on Building UX

## Introduction

I like to call myself a full stack web developer. Being a freelancer for pretty much my whole career, I had the opportunity (read: forced) to work on different technologies on both frontend and backend. Truth be told, I am not an expert in any of those things. Sure, I may have a particular skillset (in Liam Neeson's _Taken_ voice) but my skill level in any area is nothing compared to, say, a dedicated frontend or backend developer.

Just recently, I got a job (love every bit of it, by the way) that requires me to focus on the frontend. Just days into it, I remembered an old realization that just proves to be true, time and time again:

> Building UI/UX is damn hard. Anyone who tells you otherwise is full of shit.

Having said that, I like to think of myself as someone who, given enough time, can thrive on any particular task. And UI/UX, however inexperienced I may be in this area, is no exception.

I'm going to list down my thoughts and some of the things I learned (or re-learned) about building UX. Before going any further, as a warning I'd like to point out that I may just be pulling all these words out of my ass (read: I may just be making all this shit up). However you've already read this far so might as well finish the whole damn thing.

## Thoughts

### 1. Everything starts with the user

### 2. Small details matter

### 3. You don't know everything, and that's good

> You won't have everything you need from the get-go, and that's okay

### 4. Constructive criticism is gold

### 5. One more thing...

Something said by a brilliant colleague struck me:

> You can't expect to have a revolutionary product by building a traditional UI

Cheers!

...

TL;DR I got the chance to focus on building UI/UX and realized that it's not as easy as I thought it would be.
