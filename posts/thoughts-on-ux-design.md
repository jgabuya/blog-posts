# Thoughts on UX Design

## Introduction

I like to call myself a full stack web developer. Being a freelancer for pretty much my whole career, I had the opportunity (read: forced) to work on different technologies on both frontend and backend. Truth be told, I am not an expert in any of those things. Sure, I may have a particular skillset (in Liam Neeson's _Taken_ voice) but my skill level in any area is nothing compared to, say, a dedicated frontend or backend developer.

Just recently, I got a job (love every bit of it, by the way) that requires me to focus on the frontend. Just days into it, I remembered an old realization that just proves to be true, time and time again:

> Building good UX is damn hard. Anyone who tells you otherwise is full of shit.

Having said that, I like to think of myself as someone who, given enough time, can thrive on any particular task. And UI/UX (you may point out that these two are completely different things, and you are right), however inexperienced I may be in this area, should be no exception.

I'm going to list down my thoughts and some of the things I learned (or re-learned) about building UX. Before going any further, as a warning I'd like to point out that I may just be pulling all these words out of my ass (read: I may just be making all this shit up). However, you've already read this far so might as well just finish the whole damn thing.

## Thoughts

### Everything Starts with the End User

Good UX is more than just a combination of nice-looking UI elements. Instead, it encompasses the entire collection of user interactions. Therefore, good UX must have a set of  clearly-defined, intuitive user flows built into its DNA.

It goes without saying that a good UI design should not keep the user guessing. As the saying goes:

![user interface](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAZKAAAAJDIwODMxYjdhLTgyMTktNDk3Zi05NzAxLTQ0ZmJiOGUzZTQwNg.jpg "UX is like a joke")

However, designing an _intuitive_ UI  can sometimes be difficult. This is because like many other things, _intuitiveness_ is relative.
What _you_ find very intuitive might not be as easy to understand for _me_.

It's all a matter of perspective. And it differs for a lot of people, for a number of reasons: age, technical background, clarity of vision, among other things

I think the _key_ is to not only define your target users, but also attempt to strike a balance between **simplicity** and **usability**. By attempting to view the whole set of flows from a target user's perspective, one can potentially have good insights on a much more effective UX design.

### Small Details Matter

It may just be me (and my severe case of stupid OCD), but I get more attracted to something that obviously puts a lot of attention to details. In all my years of experience, I find it amusing that even small details can have a large impact to the overall end user experience:

- typos
- misaligned buttons
- poor spacing
- poorly constructed alert messages

Granted, to us developers these quirks may seem very minor (cause we have _way bigger problems_ to solve, right?). They can be fixed within minutes (even seconds in some cases). But make no mistake, once they add up they can hurt as bad as a major bug. This might be an exaggeration to some extent, but even minor UI issues in production could make a company lose a lot of money.

Therefore, it is extremely important to include QA testing in any workflow. Because a design that consistently pays attention to small details not only looks clean and elegant, but also promotes trust from its end users. It actually says a damn _LOT_ about how a company values its customers.

### Constructive Criticism is Gold

![criticism](https://viralviralvideos.com/wp-content/uploads/meme/2014/03/-Comics---Criticism-Funny-MEME-GIF.jpg "criticism")

If there's one thing I learned the hard way, it's that we should be always open for criticism - no matter how harsh they may seem to be. Here's why: **we always make mistakes whether we like it or not**

Sometimes, we put too much hardwork on something only to get our egos crushed by honest criticism. Let me tell you something: Fuck our egos. They provide a false sense of entitlement which could potentially create a gap between us and our "inferior" teammates.

It is never about you. It's about building something the best you could, and that includes getting feedback from other people.

Again, this is about _perspective_. What makes constructive criticism important is that not only it makes us aware of where we fucked up, but also provides helpful advice on how not to. It gives a whole level of perspective which we won't be able to attain by ourselves.

By opening ourselves to constructive criticism, we effectively put ourselves in the best position for growth.

### Always Iterate. Never settle.

> You won't have everything you need from the get-go, and that's okay

### One more thing...

Something said by a brilliant colleague struck me:

> You can't expect to have a revolutionary product by building a traditional UI

Cheers!

...

TL;DR I got the chance to focus on building UI/UX and learned awesome shit in the process.
