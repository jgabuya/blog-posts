# Thoughts on UX Design

## Introduction

I like to call myself a full stack web developer. Being a freelancer for pretty much my whole career, I had the opportunity (read: forced) to work on different technologies on both frontend and backend. Truth be told, I am not an expert in any of those things. Sure, I may have a particular skillset (in Liam Neeson's _Taken_ voice) but my skill level in any area is nothing compared to, say, a dedicated frontend or backend developer.

Just recently, I got a job (love every bit of it, by the way) that requires me to focus on the frontend. Just days into it, I remembered an old realization that just proves to be true, time and time again:

> Building good UX is damn hard. Anyone who tells you otherwise is full of shit.

Having said that, I like to think of myself as someone who, given enough time, can thrive on any particular task. And UI/UX (you may point out that these two are completely different things, and you are right), however inexperienced I may be in this area, should be no exception.

I'm going to list down my thoughts and some of the things I learned (or re-learned) about building UX. Before going any further, as a warning I'd like to point out that I may just be pulling all these words out of my ass (read: I may just be making all this shit up). However, you've already read this far so might as well just finish the whole damn thing.

## Thoughts

### Everything Starts with the End User

Good UX is more than just a combination of nice-looking UI elements. Instead, it encompasses the entire collection of user interactions. Therefore, good UX must have a set of  clearly-defined, intuitive user flows built into its DNA.

It goes without saying that a good UI design should not keep the user guessing. As the saying goes:

However, designing an _intuitive_ UI  can sometimes be difficult. This is because like many other things, _intuitiveness_ is relative.
What _you_ find very intuitive might not be as easy to understand for _me_.

It's all a matter of perspective. And it differs for a lot of people, for a number of reasons: age, technical background, clarity of vision, among other things

I think the _key_ is to not only define your target users, but also attempt to strike a balance between **simplicity** and **usability**. By attempting to view the whole set of flows from a target user's perspective, one can potentially have good insights on a much more effective UX design.

### Small Details Matter

It may just be me (and my severe case of OCD), but I get more attracted to something that obviously puts a lot of attention to details. However, within my years of experience

- consistency

### You don't know everything, and that's okay

> You won't have everything you need from the get-go, and that's okay

### Constructive criticism is gold

### One more thing...

Something said by a brilliant colleague struck me:

> You can't expect to have a revolutionary product by building a traditional UI

Cheers!

...

TL;DR I got the chance to focus on building UI/UX and realized that it's not as easy as I thought it would be.
